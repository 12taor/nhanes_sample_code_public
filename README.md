Sample code using the NHANES dataset from 2018

For this project, I wanted to know if education was associated with obesity in the United States. I chose a specific year, 2018, and I used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset as a nationally representative sample of body measurements and demographic data from the United States. I then chose variables I thought would be relevan for calculating BMI (height and weight) and for my exposure of interest (education), as well as potential confounders (age, gender, race), and variables that I thought would be useful for data cleaning. I then proceeded with data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and my main analysis, using a logistic regression model.

I hope that the contents of this repo will be useful for anyone looking to understand my coding style and the steps that I like to take when performing a basic analysis. Although I have included a basic model in this analysis, the main purpose of this code sample is to demonstrate what I consider to be best practices in data wrangling, as opposed to showcasing sophistocated statistical methods.
